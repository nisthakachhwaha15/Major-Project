Abstract
This project provides an upgraded Library Management System constructed using the C programming language.
Unlike basic systems that store books simply in memory, this system delivers capabilities closer to a real-world library process.

It enables users to:
•	Update the system with fresh books
•	Look up books by author, title, or ID.
•	Issue and return books
•	Keep the last borrower's name on file.
•	Display library statistics such as total books and copies


Problem Definition
Libraries have to manage a lot of books, which is challenging if done by hand. Popular actions like verifying availability or issuing a book become error-prone when done with pen and paper.

A basic digital management system ought to:
•	Organise book information cleanly
•	Permit quick searching
•	Track available copies
•	Keep borrower information up to date
•	Maintain records even after they are shut down.

This project's primary goal is to create a straightforward but enhanced library system that shows how fundamental C principles can be used to solve real-world issues.
 

Algorithms
Algorithm: Load Books from File
1.	Open the text database file.
2.	Read each line and parse book information.
3.	Store it into the array of structures.
4.	If file doesn’t exist, start with an empty library.
________________________________________
Algorithm: Add Book
1.	Ask the user for book details.
2.	Check if the ID already exists.
3.	If duplicate → display message.
4.	Otherwise → insert into list and update count.
________________________________________
Algorithm: Issue Book
1.	Ask user for book ID.
2.	Find book in the array.
3.	If available copies > 0:
o	Decrease available copies
o	Ask borrower name and save it
4.	Else display “No copies available”.
________________________________________

Algorithm: Save Books
1.	Open file in write mode.
2.	Write each book record.
3.	Close file.

Implementation Specifics and Used Programming Concepts

🔹 Structures: To organise book attributes (ID, title, author, copies).
🔹 Array of structures — To store several books in memory.
🔹 Text files – To save and load book records.
🔹 Modularity — Separate .h, .c files for clarity.
🔹 Functions: Each operation is managed independently.


Tests and Results

The program was tested in real-world situations.

Test Case 1: Loading System 
Books appear automatically upon launch if the file is present. 
If not, the program begins anew. 

Test Case 2: Add Books 
There were books written by various authors. 
Duplicate IDs were rejected, confirming validation works. 

Test Case 3: Look For Books 
ID, title, and author searches were all dependable. 
For instance: 
Input → "Orwell" Output → displays George Orwell's book "1984" 

Test Case 4: Issue and Return 
Issuing decreased available copies. 
returning more copies that are available. 
The borrower's name is recorded. 

Test Case 5: File Persistence 

After closing and reopening: 
Books remained 
Copies and last borrower remained unchanged 
This demonstrates proper file management.

Conclusion & Future Work
This extended Library Management System shows that even a few beginner-level C concepts can easily be scaled into a more realistic solution.
 Data persistence, multiple search strategies, statistics, and borrower tracking were introduced within this project.
While simple, it lays the foundation for more professional systems.

Possible Future Enhancements:
•	Student management system - who borrowed which book historically
•	Due date and fine calculator
•	Admin authentication
•	Unlimited books using a linked list or dynamic memory 

The project was a great learning experience, building valuable real-world programming skills and understanding.
